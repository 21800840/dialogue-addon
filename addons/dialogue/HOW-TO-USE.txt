You might need to reload the project (Project -> Reload Current Project) to make things work properly.

How to use:
Prerequisites - 
 - A json file formatted like this:
{
	"dialogue stage" : {
		"0" : {
			"name":"npc name",
			"text":"npc text"
		},
		"1" : {
			"name":"npc name",
			"text":"This would play straight after "0""
		}
	}
	"This is another dialogue stage" : {
		"0" : {
			"name":"npc name",
			"text":"npc text"
		}
		"1" : {
			"name":"npc name",
			"text":"This is how you add one option"
			"options" : {
				"option 1" : {
					"text":"Leave is an in built flag and will end dialogue without changing the stage",
					"flag":"leave"
				}
			}
		}
	}
	"this is a third dialogue stage" : {
		"0" : {
			"name":"npc name",
			"text":"This is how you add two options"
			"options" : {
				"option 1" : {
					"text":"Leave is an in built flag and will end dialogue without changing the stage",
					"flag":"leave"
				}
				"option 2" : {
					"text":"If you need to run a custom command when a button is pressed, you can add it in the stage-and-event-manager.gd script",
					"flag":"collect-item-2"
				}
			}
		}
	}
}

Steps - 
Step 1: Give the player an Area2D with collision and set the Collision Layer called 'Dialogue' (Layer 2 by default).
Step 2: Drag dialogue-box.tscn into the scene where dialogue would occur. (For example, a scene with both a player and an npc).
Step 3: Drag dialogue-manager.tscn onto whoever you want to give dialogue to's scene.
Step 4: Right click the DialogueManager node and enable Editable Children.
Step 5: Click on DialogueArea and give it a name, and point to it's dialogue in json form.
Step 6: Right click the DialogueArea node and enable Editable Children.
Step 7: Give whoever you want to give dialogue to a collision box of whatever size you want.
Step 8: Create an entry in the global-dialogue stage_dictionary. Example: "npc-name":"starting stage"
Step 9: In stage-and-event-manager.gd, create entries in change_dialogue_stage if you want to change stage after finishing the current one and create entires in custom_button_events() if you have to use custom events for your buttons.


Tips:
 - You can change the talk to key in the dialogue-area.gd script
